# Hashnote Blockchain Engineer Take-home Test

_This exercise is confidential and must not be shared publicly._

The purpose of this test is to assess your understanding of the EVM, Solidity, and common vulnerabilities.

## Instructions

There are 2 contracts located in `contracts/` that contain vulnerabilities.

- Write contracts `AttackPwned.sol` and `AttackSecure.sol` that attacks the vulnerabilities in each of the 2 contracts, `Pwned.sol` and `Secure.sol`.
- Create a copy of each contract with a `Fixed` prefix, i.e. `FixedPwned.sol`, fix the vulnerabilities, and make any other changes you may deem necessary.
- Write unit tests for each fixed version of the contract.
- Write deployment scripts for all 4 contracts.

## Submit

- Share a private repository with `anodaram`

## Notes

- Contracts do not need to be deployed to a testnet. Everything can be ran and tested locally.
- All contracts should be written using the latest version of Solidity.
